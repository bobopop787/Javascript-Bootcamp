# Javascript Bootcamp

Week 1:
This week you'll learn about the fundamental concepts of JavaScript and computational thinking. You'll set up everything you need on your machine to dive into coding, including functions, arrays, and scope. Throughout Week 1, you'll be executing code and even exploring simple 2D animation, finally building up to working with callback functions, and some of the newest features of ECMAScript, the standard for JavaScript, which will lay a foundation for working with asynchronous code.

Week 2:
This week, you'll delve deeper into JavaScript, continuing your exploration of asynchronous code, fetching data, and promises. Youâ€™ll hone your skills as a programmer, working more with Bootstrap, more HTML, and CSS. You'll put all your skills together and finish out strong by building a project for your portfolio and GitHub to show off your new coding prowess.
